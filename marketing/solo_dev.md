solo_dev

Hi!
I’m a solo developer and I’m starting closed testing (~10 people) for a choose-your-own-adventure storytelling app ([Talewell home page](https://narratoengine.com/talewell/)).

At the moment, I only have two stories suitable for parents reading to children. But the core engine is complete. It focuses on visuals and interaction:

    📚 Interactive stories
    🧭 Choose Your Path: Every decision changes the story.
    🎨 Beautiful Art & Music: Handcrafted scenes and soundscapes bring stories to life.

The application is in closed testing, but it is stable. I’m mainly looking for people who read to children regularly and are open to sharing feedback a ~4 week beta.

If you’re interested, feel free to comment, DM me, or sign-up for the [alpha](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0Y_7cZslFFT52hyXFEzbYOhfjorAhh51RR0NRHl7CcGBnlQ/viewform).

Thanks!
